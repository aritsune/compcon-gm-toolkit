While this system is active, this mech is immobilized, but all ranged, melee, or tech attacks against any character or object within a burst 3 zone around this mech originating outside of that zone take +2 Difficulty. Attacks out of the zone or between targets that are both inside of the zone are unaffected. It can be deactivated as a full action, and it automatically deactivates if the Aegis is stunned, jammed, or destroyed. If the Aegis is involuntarily moved (such as from knock back), the field does not deactivate, but moves with it."
"EM Shielding","The Aegis and allied characters inside it’s defense net are immune to the impaired condition, and any allied character that moves inside of the defense net can immediately end the impaired condition on itself."

"HA Blackwall System","The Aegis creates a pitch black wall of blinkspace that takes up a free line 10 zone 5 spaces high that must have at least one point within 5 spaces of the Aegis. The wall completely blocks line of sight between its two sides and no effect or attack can be drawn across it. Any character that starts its turn on the wall or crosses it for the first time on its turn has a 50% chance to be lost in blinkspace momentarily. If this occurs, remove the mech from play. It returns at the end of its next turn, in any free space chosen by that character within range 10 of either side of the wall. If there is no space available, it returns when there is. The wall disappears when the Aegis is destroyed or it uses an action to deactivate it, also returning any stranded mechs."
ARCHER
"Suppress","One target in range 10 and line of sight of the Archer is impaired. If it starts any movement, the archer can attack it once with any weapon as a reaction, but this effect ends after the archer attacks, hit or miss. The target can also immediately end this effect by damaging the archer. It also ends if the archer loses line of sight to its target, if the archer is stunned, jammed, or destroyed, if the archer chooses a new target, or ends this effect as a free action."
"Superior Sentinel","The Archer has +1 accuracy on all reaction fire (overwatch, etc)."

"Snare Drone","The Barricade rapidly prints and deploys a snare drone in a free adjacent space. This drone is size 1/2, has 10/12/14 evasion and e-defense and 5 HP/tier. When any hostile mech moves within range 3 of the drone or starts its turn in range of the drone, it emits a pulse, immediately immobilizing that mech until the drone is destroyed (no save allowed)."
BASTION
"Shieldwall","As long as it’s holding its shield, the Bastion and one adjacent mech of its choice has resistance to all damage from a target of its choosing that it can see.

If any ranged or melee attack without the seeking tag would be made in such a way that it crosses the line (even if it doesn’t target the pyro), roll a d6. On a 4+, the pyro reduces all damage from the attack to 0 and cancels all other effects the attack would have. The field disappears at the start of the pyro’s turn, or if the pyro is stunned, shut down, or moved for any reason."

"HOUND missile","Choose a target within range 20 and line of sight. The Rainmaker fires a hound missile at the target, which is a drone with size 1/2, evasion/e-defense 10, and 10/15/20 HP. The missile primes on the turn that it is fired, deploying in an adjacent space, then flies 5 at the start of each of the rainmaker’s subsequent turns. If its target suffers from the Lock On condition, its movement increases to 10. It must move as far as possible directly towards its target, but maneuvers around cover and obstacles as long as there is space to do so. If the missile’s movement causes it to collide with any character, it detonates for a blast 1 explosion. Characters caught inside must pass an agility save or take 16/20/24 energy damage and half on a successful check."

A character that fails this save is immobilized until the end of its next turn, then slowed until the end of its subsequent turn. Shock Mine - Systems save. A character that fails this save is Jammed until the end of its next turn, then impaired until the end of its subsequent turn."
"Hopping Mines","The seeder’s mines also trigger when a character flies or moves over their area up to 10 spaces above them."

SNIPER
"Sniper's Mark","The Sniper marks a target within range 25 and line of sight. While marked, the Sniper’s anti material rifle attacks against that target causes it to take 1 structure damage on hit instead of dealing damage normally. The Sniper can only have one mark active at a time, but can transfer it if need be by taking this action again. The target is aware of this effect and avoid it if it is in any kind of cover, instead taking damage normally. It can also voluntarily drop prone as a free action on its turn while this mark is active. While it’s prone, it ignores this effect and takes damage normally."

A single drone can be removed by making a successful systems or engineering skill check as a quick action (an adjacent ally can also make this check). The drones can also be confused by shutting the affected mech down, which pauses the timer. The pilot in the affected mech is aware of how much time they have before the drones bore through."
